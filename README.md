# Mersenne-Prime-Finder
This C program determines whether a given number is a perfect number and, if so, attempts to identify the corresponding Mersenne prime used to generate it. It combines basic number theory functions like checking for primality and calculating divisors with powers of two to reverse-engineer Mersenne primes.
